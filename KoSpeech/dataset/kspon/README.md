# KsponSpeech-preprocess
#### Pre-processing KsponSpeech corpus priveded by AI Hub
   
It's been a while since KsponSpeech was released, but it's hard to compare performance because there's no established preprocessing method. So we're revealing the pre-processing method we used in the [KoSpeech](https://github.com/sooftware/KoSpeech) project. This project provides processing in characters, subwords, and grapheme units.    
  
## Intro

`KsponSpeech-preprocess` is repository for pre-processing `KsponSpeech corpus` provided by AI Hub.  
**KsponSpeech corpus** is a **1000h** Korean speech data corpus provided by [AI Hub](http://www.aihub.or.kr/) in Korea.   
Anyone can download this dataset just by applying. The transcription rules can see [here](http://www.aihub.or.kr/sites/default/files/2019-12/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4%20%EC%9D%8C%EC%84%B1%20%EC%A0%84%EC%82%AC%EA%B7%9C%EC%B9%99%20v1.0.pdf).  
  
You can pre-process in various output-units, such as ***character, subword, grapheme***  
We will explain the details in the **Output-Unit** part below.
   
## Prerequisites
* Pandas: `pip install pandas` (Refer [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) for problem installing Pandas)  
* Sentencepiece: `pip install sentencepiece` (Refer [here](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) for problem installing Sentencepiece) 
  
## Usage
  
1. Set options in [preprocess.sh](https://github.com/sooftware/KsponSpeech-preprocess/blob/master/preprocess.sh)  
  
2. Run [preprocess.sh](https://github.com/sooftware/KsponSpeech-preprocess/blob/master/preprocess.sh)  
```shell
$ ./preprocess.sh
```
  
3. Leave the computer for minutes or hours.  
  
* Results : transcripts.txt (default: `~KoSpeech/data/transcripts.txt`)

## Preprocess
  
You can choose between phonetic transcription and spelling transcription to preprocess.  
  
* Raw data
```
b/ (70%)/(칠 십 퍼센트) 확률이라니 아/ (뭐+ 뭔)/(모+ 몬) 소리야 진짜 (100%)(백 프로)가 왜 안돼? n/
``` 
  
* Delete noise labels, such as b/, n/, / ..
```
(70%)/(칠 십 퍼센트) 확률이라니 아/ (뭐+ 뭔)/(모+ 몬) 소리야 진짜 (100%)(백 프로)가 왜 안돼?
```
  
* Delete labels such as '/', '*', '+', etc. (used for interjection representation)
```
(70%)/(칠 십 퍼센트) 확률이라니 아 (뭐 뭔)/(모 몬) 소리야 진짜 (100%)(백 프로)가 왜 안돼?
```
  
* Option1 : phonetic transcript
```
칠 십 퍼센트 확률이라니 아 모 몬 소리야 진짜 백 프로가 왜 안돼?
```

* Option2 : spelling transcript
```
70% 확률이라니 아 뭐 뭔 소리야 진짜 100%가 왜 안돼?
```
  
## Output-Unit
   
This project provides processing in characters, subwords, and grapheme units.   
  
* Character-Unit
```
아 모 몬 소리야 칠 십 퍼센트 확률이라니
```
  
* Subword-Unit
```
▁아 ▁모 ▁ 몬 ▁소리 야 ▁ 칠 ▁ 십 ▁퍼 센트 ▁확 률 이라 니
```

* Grapheme-Unit
```
ㅇㅏ ㅁㅗ ㅁㅗㄴ ㅅㅗㄹㅣㅇㅑ ㅊㅣㄹ ㅅㅣㅂ ㅍㅓㅅㅔㄴㅌㅡ ㅎㅘㄱㄹㅠㄹㅇㅣㄹㅏㄴㅣ
```
   
## Conversion to id
  
* transcript
```
아 모 몬 소리야 칠 십 퍼센트 확률이라니
```

* conversion
